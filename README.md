MiniChallengeTwoToFour - Endpoints
Brief Description: I made 3 seperate endpoints one that adds two numbers, one that checks if one number is larger than the other, and a third that takes your name and what time you woke up and outputs it in a sentence.

Peer Review: I liked the use of "doubles". All the codes run properly and do exactly what they are intended to do. It also makes sure that the user's input is in the right format. Great work all around!
